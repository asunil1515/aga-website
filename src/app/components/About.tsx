          <h3>ABOUT OUR CHURCH</h3>
          <p>
            Amazing Grace Assembly is a Bible-based church located in Pearland,
            Texas. We provide a combined South Indian (Malayalam) and English
            service each Sunday morning along with various other services
            throughout the week. Our churchâ€™s goal is to see individuals
            experience the Amazing Grace that saves lost and broken people
            through a personal encounter with Jesus.
